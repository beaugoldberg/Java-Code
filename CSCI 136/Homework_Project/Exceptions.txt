Why I Chose My Exceptions:

I chose to do try-catches surrounded by a while loop to get the user to enter a number because it seemed the the best way to 
handle an input mismatch excpetion for the integers

I chose to do pattern matching for almost all of my user input that was strings because it wont
say input mismatch error because technically a number will just be taken as a string but since i wanted
only strings containing letters from the user i did it that way. It allowed me to limit the 
input to letters and not numbersand in some cases allowed me to force a specific pattern in order to avoid
 a parse error.
 
 I used some while loops in some places to continue to prompt the user until they entered one of the actions that was presented 
 which avoid an input mismatch error and a sudden crash.
